    "\n",
    "## Interviews Should\n",
    "- Match the job day to day \n",
    "- Be project based over a few days\n",
    "- Allow the interviewer to show their imagination (a number of data science solutions and break throughs are not complex but clever)\n",

    "## Interviews Should Not:\n",
    "- Be computer science algorithm based? (unless using BFS at work it shouldn't be tested)\n",
    "- Involve coding under a clock? I've never missed a project due to needing an extra 30 min. Oh yeah, and EVERYONE uses stackoverflow and google in some capacity\n",

    "## My favorite interviews: \n",
    "- Open ended problem solving projects. It tests my ability to meet a deadline, use my imagination and explain my process but these are also some of the most difficult interviews to create....I've attempted it before"

    "- Finding an open sourced dataset was harder than anticpated \n",
    "- Some candidates were confused by our laxed instructions. Saying \"Here's some data, explore it, and tell us what you'd do to it\" left some candidated asking for direction\n",
