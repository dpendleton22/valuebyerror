<h2 id="What-This-Post-is-About:">What This Post is About:<a class="anchor-link" href="#What-This-Post-is-About:"> </a></h2><p>Data science interviews and their process....that's it (This isn't about computer science based interviews)</p>
<h2 id="Interviews-Should">Interviews Should<a class="anchor-link" href="#Interviews-Should"> </a></h2><ul>
<li>Match the job day to day </li>
<li>Be project based over a few days</li>
<li>Allow the interviewer to show their imagination (a number of data science solutions and break throughs are not complex but clever)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Interviews-Should-Not:">Interviews Should Not:<a class="anchor-link" href="#Interviews-Should-Not:"> </a></h2><ul>
<li>Be computer science algorithm based? (unless using BFS at work it shouldn't be tested)</li>
<li>Involve coding under a clock? I've never missed a project due to needing an extra 30 min. Oh yeah, and EVERYONE uses stackoverflow and google in some capacity

<h2 id="My-favorite-interviews:">My favorite interviews:<a class="anchor-link" href="#My-favorite-interviews:"> </a></h2><ul>
<li>Open ended problem solving projects. It tests my ability to meet a deadline, use my imagination and explain my process but these are also some of the most difficult interviews to create....I've attempted it before</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="My-Dumpster-Fire:-Creating-an-interview">My Dumpster Fire: Creating an interview<a class="anchor-link" href="#My-Dumpster-Fire:-Creating-an-interview"> </a></h2><p>My team let me lead an interview process for a data science researcher. I made the job description, set the qualifications and created the code interview. This is how it went and what I learned

<h3 id="What-I-was-trying-to-do:">What I was trying to do:<a class="anchor-link" href="#What-I-was-trying-to-do:"> </a></h3><ul>
<li>Create an interview process to determine the right candidates for our research group</li>
<li>Type of interview: Project (1 week)</li>
<li>Data: 3 Open sourced sets from Kaggle (candidate selected one)</li>
<li>Task: Provide analysis of data and how a model would be used to solve a potential problem in that industry</li>

<h3 id="What-actually-happened:">What actually happened:<a class="anchor-link" href="#What-actually-happened:"> </a></h3><ul>
<li>The removal of creating and implementing a model set the bar too low. By the fourth candidate, we saw very similar analysis presentations</li>
<li>Finding an open sourced dataset was harder than anticpated </li>
<li>Some candidates were confused by our laxed instructions. Saying "Here's some data, explore it, and tell us what you'd do to it" left some candidated asking for direction
<img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/3o7aCTPPm4OHfRLSH6/giphy.gif" alt="confused"></li>
<li>Only a handful of candidates actually took advantage of pulling in more open sourced data</li>

<li>Don't take it personal. You may think you have work to do but data science interviews also need some fixing</li>
<li>Show some initiative! Start a self-project, you'll be able to show it in every interview</li>
<li>If you have an algorithm on your resume, you should be able to speak to it</li>

<li>Be your own worst critic. Is what you're asking the candidate to do and answer what you would expect from your current team to know?</li>
<li>Are you structuring interviews to allow for someone to show their creativity? Data science is not just strictly math and code</li>
<li>Is the interview similar to a project they would work on?</li>
