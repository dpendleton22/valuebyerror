I remember a joke during my undergrate years, "if engineers got everything right the first time they'd be called magicians". As a foundational engineer I am skilled at correcting myself and learning from my mistakes. Data science is far from perfect but there are plenty of skills I gained as an engineer that I use in my data science job. One major skill is not over reacting from errors and learning how to measure them and not repeat them. ValuebyError is my open notes on the steps I have and continue to take as I gain my skills in the data science field. Posts will include projects I've done, lessons learned from projects and general thoughts on things occuring in the data science field.

I spent about 3 years as an engineer with some software experience and made the transition to being a dedicated data scientist. I have 2 years of applied data scinece research experience and a masters in computer science from Georgia Tech.
